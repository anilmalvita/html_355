    <article>hii everyone these is my work done profile</article>
    <article>completre first registration and then we go to apply the job  and enjoy the survice </article>
    <article>I did my articleship at CNK & Associates LLP during 2015–2018, while simultaneously studying B.Com. and M.Com, so it was pretty intense. I think I can divide my articleship experience in the following 3 phases:

Phase 1: Learning (and mastering) the basics - Initial 9–12 Months

I think this is the most crucial, yet boring phase of articleship. During these initial phase I learnt and mastered the following (seemingly useless at the time but very important afterwards) skills:

Basic Documentation, which included the work such as finding a center for punching a hole in the papers so that all papers are punched form the center and can be filed meticulously, tagging and indexing a file, learning various printing techniques, numbering the documents and all such micro level documentation techniques on can think of.
Vouching and Physical Verification, which initially seemed like a mechanical process of just posting an ‘inverted tick’ on the invoice as an evidence that the invoice was checked, but after sometime you realize that it is much more than that. If done properly, it can help to find out major irregularity and even fraud in the books, which I actually found out.
Excel, Powerpoint and Word; which are the fundamental skills beside accounting, taxation and auditing for any chartered. During this phase I got the basics of excel such as vlookups, nested ifs and basic pivots; report preparation in word and presentations in powerpoint. During 2nd and 3rd year, I basically got mastery of excel, ranging form complex formulas and pivots to building macros for mass formatting (and later on sharing this with juniors).
Phase 2: Building upon the Fundamentals - The Second Year

Now this was the phase during which the real fun of articleship started. As you become ‘senior’, you will start getting some cream work. (and also punching long hours). This is also the time when you start taking CA Final studies more seriously as suddenly you will hit with this: “Oh man! Now I have only two years left to cover 8 subjects. I have to be serious”. The learning was intensified in the following manner:

Basic Analysis: I started moving away from vouching to ledger scrutiny and Balance Sheet/P&L analysis. I was also handed to conduct small level (Proprietors, small partnerships) tax audits and internal audits, which further helped me to develop my analytical skills.
Statutory Audit: I was included in a team of statutory audit of a listed entity. For any article of a non big 4 firm, getting into a team of statutory audit can truly be a major milestone for learning, as this is the most responsibility oriented work an article can have. During statutory audit, you realize the importance of a chartered accountant’s signature. You also learn how various Standards of auditing, provisions of Companies Act and LODR requirements can be applied practically.
Basic Interaction With Client: I was also given the opportunity to directly interact with the clients for query solving and helping them out to resolve various issues.
Phase 3: Final Touches - The Third Year

As you enter in the final year of articleship, you kinda become a ‘veteran’ or ‘father figure’ for new-fresh first year articles. During this last phase, I was given opportunity to lead the team of young articles as well as direct interaction with the clients. This period was also consisting an intense, 6 months preparation of CA Final exams (With M.Com exams). This year was to give final touches to what I have learnt during first two years, encapsulate it, develop soft skills such as leadership and effective communication and study hard in the exam leave to crack CA Finals in 1st attempt.

In nutshell, articleship helped me to become a much evolved and developed professional in a relatively very short span of time.

What is a QR code scam, and what steps should you take to protect yourself?
A QR code scam is a type of cyber fraud where scammers trick people into scanning fake or tampered QR codes. Once scanned, the code might steal your data, install malware or transfer money without your knowledge by leading you to malicious websites or fake payment pages. Since QR codes don’t reveal their destination visibly, users often scan them before thinking twice.

Imagine you are at a cafe and scan a QR code on the table to pay your bill—but it’s a fake sticker placed over the real code and your money gets transferred to a fraudster instead.

Or you get a message with a QR code for a 'free g… (more)

Can you tell me about your work experience? How many jobs have you had and how did each of them end?
I have my work experience of 4 years and 10 month with TCS.

Throughout my career in TCS I switched 2–3 roles.

The last role I had was of an SAP Consultant for an oil and gas industry for a foreign client.

The experience was quite monotonous because you get up and repeat the same work again and again with only a few updates that too quite rarely.

But during my time in TCS I made sure that I completed certain courses related to the field I was working and learn through it.

I ended my job with TCS because of less growth opportunities. Now I am pursuing my MBA from SCMHRD as I wanted to grow my career.</article>
